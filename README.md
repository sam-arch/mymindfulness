mindfulness in go
This is the web server code for the mymindfulness website. Also included is the css, js, and other stuff that i intend
to use as i learn web programming in Go.
The code is dirty..very dirty, other things could have been handled better, but i had to learn
and implement all in 3 weeks :(. Bear with me, talk to me about updates and better coding practices.
I'm all ears world :)
