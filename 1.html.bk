            <p id="one" >Mindfulness is moment-to-moment, non-judgmental awareness, cultivated by paying attention. Mindfulness arises naturally from living. It can be strengthened through practice. This practice is sometimes called meditation. <b>But meditation is not what you think.</b><br /><br />
Meditation is really about paying attention, and the only way in which we can pay attention is through our senses, all of them, including the mind. Mindfulness is a way of <b>befriending ourselves</b> and <b>our experience.</b> Of course, our experience is vast, and includes our own body, our mind, our heart, and the entire world.</p> 
<p id="two">In Asian languages, the word for <i>mind</i> and the word for <i>heart</i> are the same word. So when we hear the word <i>mindfulness</i>, <b>we have to inwardly also hear heartfulness</b> in order to grasp it even as a concept, and especially as <b>a way of being.</b></p>
<p id="three">Many people are first drawn to the practice of mindfulness because of stress or pain of one kind or another and their dissatisfaction with elements of their lives that they somehow sense might be set right through the gentle ministrations of direct observation, inquiry, and self-compassion. Stress and pain thus become <b>potentially valuable portals</b> and <b>motivators</b> through which to enter the practice.<br /><br />

<p id="four">One scholar described mindfulness as “the unfailing master key for <b>knowing</b> the mind, and thus the starting point; the perfect tool for <b>shaping</b> the mind, and thus the focal point; and the lofty manifestation of the achieved <b>freedom</b> of the mind, and thus the culminating point.” Not bad for something that basically boils down to paying attention.</p>
<p id="five">Mindfulness has been called the <i>heart of Buddhist meditation</i>. Even so, there is nothing particularly Buddhist about attention or awareness. The essence of mindfulness is truly universal. It has more to do with the <b>nature of the human mind</b> than it does with ideology, beliefs, or culture. It has more to do with our capacity for knowing, with what is called <i>sentience</i>, than with a particular religion, philosophy, or view.

<p id="six">The Buddha once said that the core message of all his teachings could be summed up in one sentence. On the off chance that that is so, it might not be a bad idea to commit that sentence to memory. You never know when it might come in handy, when it might make sense to you, even though it didn’t the moment before. That sentence is: <i>“Nothing is to be clung to as I, me, or mine.”</i> In other words, <b>no attachments</b>—especially to fixed ideas of yourself and who you are.</p>
<p id="seven">When mindfulness is cultivated intentionally, it is sometimes referred to as <b>deliberate mindfulness.</b> When it is available to us spontaneously, as it tends to be more and more, the more it is cultivated intentionally, it is sometimes referred to as <b>effortless mindfulness.</b> Ultimately, however arrived at, mindfulness is mindfulness.<br />
<b>We take care of the future best by taking care of the present <i>now</i>.</b><br />
